# GUARDING-AGAINST-JOB-SCAMS-HARNESSING-DECISION-TREE-ANALYSIS
Online job scams are increasing. We developed a data mining system to detect fake job postings using text mining and NLP to extract features. We then applied machine learning (decision trees, Na√Øve Bayes, neural networks) to classify them. Key indicators include specific words and unusual job titles. Our model helps job portals protect job seekers.
